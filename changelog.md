# **0.4.0 - The Silent Update** 
<Details>

 # **IMPORTANT PLEASE READ - THIS VERSION IS NOT SAVE SAFE**
 
## **MAIN REASON FOR THIS VERSION:** 
 > I messed up the compilation and made the list unplayable. 
 > It is now playable but I was mid dev on this update when I realized the issue. 
 > The modlist is fine, however it set me back a little bit and some towns are now vanilla until next version.
